The project "Cookie Clicker" is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
It is a simple web-based game where the objective is to click on a cookie to earn points.
The HTML is used to structure the game's elements, the CSS is used for styling and layout,
and the JavaScript handles the game logic, such as tracking the number of clicks, updating the score.
The combination of these technologies allows for an interactive and enjoyable user experience in the browser.
